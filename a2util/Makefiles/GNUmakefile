# The useable goals:
#    all        - (default) compiles source, builds library, links executable
#    pponly     - preprocesses .F, .F90, and .F95 files
#    debug      - (USE THIS OFTEN) lists the behavior make will take when
#                 treating each and every file
#    install    - ${INSTALL}s the library, binary, and/or *.mod files to the
#                 directories specified by DIR_INST*
#                 NOTE: currbin and currlib are dependcies of install so
#                 `gmake install` will attempt to make the library and
#                 binary if they do not exist. This is in line with the
#                 standard GNU `make install` convention.
#    clean      - removes everything that can be generated by make
#    binclean   - removes the current executable
#    libclean   - removes the current executable and library
#    ppclean    - removes the current executable, library, and intermediates
#                 (source files from sources with pre-processor directives --
#                 for use when you want to change defines or include files)
#    distclean  - an alias for clean except when used by a top-level make
#    backup(*)  - (USE BEFORE `gmake clean`) copies ${SLUDGE} to backup.${DATE}
#    archive(*) - puts source and ./include into ${CURR}.tgz compressed archive

#          x${CURR}
#      include/

#
# Why do we do this? Well, there are a number of ways to build huge and complex
# programs. One way is to have a different Makefile for every AME and ASL
# (ACES Member Executable and ACES Shared Library) but that would require
# everyone to learn how to write, maintain, and debug Makefiles not to mention
# the work required to add a few subroutines or reorganize a directory
# structure. Abiding by the directory hierarchy means one Makefile can be
# used for all the executables and libraries with minimal customization
# (accomplished via Makefile.src).
# The main problem with this implementation is active porting. Anyone wishing
# to port the code to another machine, architecture or operating system, will
# have to investigate which tools are available for building and archiving.
# If someone had the time and willingness, GNU's autoconf and automake could be
# used to make porting trivial.

#

# NOTES_ON_EDITING

# Edit this file ONLY if you are porting the code to a new computer or
# if you find a bug, which should be reported to ACES technical support;
# otherwise, PLEASE create and edit a Makefile.src file since it will
# override any variable found in the initialization section(s) anyway.

# This Makefile is designed specifically for GNU make and will certainly
# not work (yet) with standard make.

# Referencing variables:
# GNU make allows two forms of variable reference:
#    ${variable} and $(variable).
# Since make doesn't care one way or the other for most of these, we will use
# a convention such that the offset characters have meaning. The convention
# we choose to use is {} for expanded reference and () for stored reference.
# This means: if a variable is to be referenced and its contents are a simple
# string, then call it ${simple_variable}; however, if a variable's contents
# are updated at the moment it is referenced, then call it $(JIT_variable).
# Functions and commands are also offset with parentheses instead of braces.

# Selecting cases for variables:
# GNU make is case sensitive but humans tend not to be; however, if we force
# all variables to be upper or lower case, then we will have many variables
# whose names are derived from other variables like BUILDBIN and INT_BUILDBIN
# for the user-defineable variable and the name of its internal variable. So,
# to decrease the amount of programming needed, variables in all caps will
# be reserved for user variables like those found in Makefile.src and those
# specified on the command line and variables in lower case will be for the
# internal Makefile equivalents. The best example of this is BUILDBIN and
# buildbin. If the user sets BUILDBIN on the command line, then the internal
# logic based on it will be completely screwed up since its value will never
# be changed; therefore, we evaluate BUILDBIN once and set buildbin based on
# it.

# END NOTES_ON_EDITING

# NOTES_ON_STYLE

# For some reason, a few terminals don't respond well to scrolling
# two consecutive carriage returns; however, a few blank lines are
# more visually appealing than horizontal rules. Therefore, a hash
# should be used to break up such sequences.

# There are many configurable variables, some have default settings and
# some don't. Every now and then, to decrease obfuscation, the default
# value will be listed in brackets following the variable and a hash. E.G.,
# tmp := ${DIR_INSTINC} # [../lib]
# BUT, an anomoly was found in which adding the default value in a comment
# caused the error message "test: syntax error" every time a file was compiled.

# The more programming languages this file needs to support, the more
# complicated the flag parsing becomes. Already we support C++, C, and
# three FORTRANs. If anyone can think of a better way to divide and
# conquer all these possibilities, please, send the suggestions to
# ${TECHSUPPORT}.

#          } These variables are primarily used in the porting section
#    MACH  } for setting various flags, directories, and commands unique to

# Basic UNIX commands
#    SHELL, TOUCH, ECHO

#
#    C, F9X, and F have at least the following variables
#       $*C           - the compiler command
#       $*FLAGS       - overrides all other flags (save "-c") if set on the CL
#       $*FLAGS_EXTRA - added to $*FLAGS
#
#    special variables for the preceding commands
#       MODDIRS_PREFIX - prepends to ${INCDIRS} when compiling F9X
#
#    the object archiver
#       AR         - the archiver command
#       AR_REPLACE - flag for replacing objects in a library
